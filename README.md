# TheDereck.GitHub.com #

This is the blog and website of Dereck Curry built using the [gh-pages-blog](http://thedereck.github.com/gh-pages-blog) software. Actually this isn't the blog and website, but the source code behind the blog and website.

Unless you're just checking out the markdown or html used for specific posts and pages, there really isn't much to see here. If you're here for the content, it really looks much better on the actual [GithHub page](http://thedereck.github.com). You really should check that out.

If you're interested in the [gh-pages-blog](http://thedereck.github.com/gh-pages-blog) software, you can easily fork it and have your own GitHub pages based blog and website set up in just a few minutes. The [Getting Started Guide](http://thedereck.github.com/gh-pages-blog/user-manual/getting-started.html) will tell you all you need to know.

Thanks for stopping by.

Dereck
