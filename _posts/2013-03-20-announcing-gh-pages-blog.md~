I just wanted to take a moment and announce my first GitHub project: [gh-pages-blog](http://thedereck.github.com/gh-pages-blog).

gh-pages-blog is a blogging solution for GitHub users and projects using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). Simply put, it's a blogging solution built around GitHub Pages and [Bootstrap's](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) responsive design tools.

Any person familiar with the basics of GitHub should be able to have a blog up and running using [gh-pages-blog](http://thedereck.github.com/gh-pages-blog) in a matter of a few minutes.

I'm using gh-pages-blog to power my own blog [here](http://thedereck.github.com).

For more information, visit the [gh-pages-blog GitHub Page](http://thedereck.github.com/gh-pages-blog).

Happy blogging.
